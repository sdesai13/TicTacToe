# TicTacToe
Welcome to TicTacToe! This is a command line interface implementation of the popular TicTacToe game. To play the game, simply run the Python script, and choose X and O for each respective player. The game will then prompt you to input the index number of the spot you wish to place your symbol on. 

Here is the guide for which index number corresponds to which spot on the game board:

The game will give an error if you attempt to place your symbol on an occupied spot, or if you input a non numeric input. You will need to ensure that you have IPython downloaded in your local environment as it is a dependency. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions about the code or how to run the game!
